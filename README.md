# Zero-to-Hero
Course Challenges: Python from Zero to Hero of the ESFM Programming Club.

Hello, genius!

In this repository you can find quite fun and very comfortable challenges if you are just starting out in the wonderful world of programming.
In addition, you will also find the Final Project: a program that organizes the files contained in a folder in folders according to their extension.

These challenges and project were proposed by the ESFM CoP during the Python from Zero to Hero course.

I hope you enjoy it!
